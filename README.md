Jiant
=====

    Javascript Interface Abstract Notation

The aim of this project is maximally reduce complexity of large ajax, highly dynamic 
javascript project development and support. 

Initially Jiant provided means for modern auto-complete tools. Jiant eliminates usage of strings for UI elements identification as far as possible, replacing it by variables. It also moves linking of html elements to javascript variables  from execution time to start time where possible.
Later evolution made Jiant covering all aspects of client UI framework, such as server connectivity, application states, event bus, data models, MVC implementation, templating, cross domain, dependency management, logic abstraction.

Jiant is more of philosophy how to develop application, not particular technical implementation of set of tricks.
